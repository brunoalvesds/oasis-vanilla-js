# Oasis - Interface Development (HTML/CSS/SASS/Vanilla JavaScript)

Notes:

- In this project I used Bootstrap as a framework just to make front-end development more agile.
- I tried to use only pure JavaScript functions, I researched a good part of the solutions, but I used the ones that I understood best.
- I only used Vanilla JS libraries, always looking for tools in ES6.
- I tried to name all classes according to the BEM standard, using camelCasing and the English language.

* I sought to improve my CSS techniques and learn new tools in this project, as in the case of the new Bootstrap 4 and Glide.js.
